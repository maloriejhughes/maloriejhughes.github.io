NOTE: 

[1] If you plan to put your html on the internets, don't go nuts on minor changes to aethetics 
    without peridically pushing the changes and previewing. Unfortunately the RStudio viewer and 
    and the in-browser preview can differ slightly from the published html.

[2] Speaking of browsers, confirm that your end users are sane/willing to use chrome 
    (if not, preview the published html on the browsers they'll use and good luck.)

[3] I don't know sh* about css.  
    The following contains code I've copied/pasted/edtied, and I think I know what does what.  
    This css may not be the best way--there could be redundancies or flat out lies, but I guess that's 
    the point: even you, dear R user, have no excuse for your ugly dashboards. Make them pretty. 
    
    Make an extreme change to a setting to see how it impacts the dashboard layout.

You can set some "header levels" here to use like functions.  If you want some text to stand out
between plots, or whenever, you can assign some of these in the CSS and use them like html functions.  
For ex, to apply the h1 "function" to some text, in the markdown you'd type:
